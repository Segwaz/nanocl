## Installation

To install **Nanocl** for your system, please refer to our online [installation guide][nanocl_install_guide].

## Documentation

To learn more about **Nanocl**, you can take a look at the following resources:

- [Overview][nanocl_overview]
- [Get Started][nanocl_get_started]
- [CLI References][nanocl_cli_ref]
- [DAEMON References][nanocl_daemon_ref]

## Usage

**Nanocl** is designed to be easy to operate by mostly using **Statefiles**.<br />
**Statefiles** are `yaml`, `toml` or `json` files that define the state you want.<br />
There is an example used to deploy our [documentation][documentation]:

```yaml
ApiVersion: v0.15

# See all options:
# https://docs.next-hat.com/references/nanocl/objects/cargo
Cargoes:
- Name: doc
  Container:
    Image: ghcr.io/next-hat/documentation:0.15.0

# See all options:
# https://docs.next-hat.com/references/nanocl/objects/resource
Resources:
- Name: docs.next-hat.com
  Kind: ncproxy.io/rule
  Data:
    Rules:
    - Domain: docs.next-hat.com
      Network: Public
      Locations:
      - Path: /
        Target:
          Key: doc.global.c
          Port: 80
```

To apply a state you can do it easily bu running `nanocl state apply -s path|url`<br />
You can also remove a state by calling `nanocl state rm -s path|url`<br />

## Architecture

**Nanocl** is designed in a **micro services** architecture several component are required and they are running as **container** included the **Nanocl Daemon** itself.
The following components will be installed during `nanocl install` and are required to ensure **Nanocl** functionality:

- `nstore` to save our state
- `ndaemon` as **REST API** to manage everything
- `nmetrics` to monitor cpu, memory and network usage
- `nproxy` proxy to redirect traffic to our **containers** and **virtual machines** (optional)
- `ncproxy` to update proxy configuration based on the current state (optional)
- `ndns` to manage the dns entries for the **containers** and **virtual machines** (optional)
- `ncdns` to update dns entries based on the current state (optional)
