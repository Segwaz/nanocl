## üìô Overview

## ‚ùì What is nanocl ?

Nanocl, stand for `Nano Cloud` and it's a lie because you will be able to create big ones.
I see it as an open-source Hybrid Cloud Orchestrator!
To help orchestrate containers and virtual machines on multiple hosts.
It provides basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling.
Using Nanocl toolskit you will be able to create your own Hybrid Cloud with optional Vpn and DNS controllers.
Deploying your applications, services or servers publicly or behind a Vpn has never been that easy!

Builds upon `Rust` to have the best performance and the smallest footprint.
It uses the best ideas and practices from the community.
You can build an entire CI/CD pipeline from tests to high-availability production.
See it as a Kubernetes alternative with more features and a network security layer.

This repository is the CLI version you can see the DAEMON [here](https://github.com/nxthat/nanocld).
